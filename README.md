# Java-microserverice-for-User-Provisioning-IAS-IPS-Simulation---SAP-BTP
# üöÄ SAP BTP Java App for User Provisioning (IAS/IPS Simulation)

A Spring Boot-based microservice designed to simulate secure user provisioning using **SAP BTP**, **XSUAA**, and **SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS)** concepts. This proof-of-concept demonstrates how to validate incoming requests via **JWT tokens**, authorize user actions based on scopes, and provision users securely.

## üìå Use Case

This project simulates a **real-world SAP IAM scenario** at large enterprises like **Daimler Truck**:

> When a new employee joins, the IT system must create a corresponding user in SAP, assign appropriate role collections, and ensure the user has secure, role-based access across SAP systems (e.g., S/4HANA, Analytics Cloud).

This app:
- Accepts RESTful onboarding requests
- Verifies caller permissions using **SAP XSUAA JWT**
- Simulates interaction with **SAP IAS/IPS** for user provisioning
- Provides a secure, extensible base for real-world SAP Identity Management
